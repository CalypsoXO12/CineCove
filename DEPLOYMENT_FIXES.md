## Testing Your Deployment:

1. **Health Check**: Visit `https://cinecove.onrender.com/health`
   - Should show status, environment, and TMDB configuration

2. **API Test**: Visit `https://cinecove.onrender.com/api/search/tmdb?query=batman`
   - Should return movie results or empty array

3. **Main App**: Visit `https://cinecove.onrender.com`
   - Should load the full application

## Environment Variables Required:
- `TMDB_API_KEY`: Your API key from themoviedb.org
- `NODE_ENV`: production
- `DATABASE_URL`: Auto-configured by Render

## Post-Deployment Steps:
1. Check the health endpoint shows TMDB is configured
2. Test media search functionality
3. Verify admin login (Calypso / lordofdarkness12)
4. Test all CRUD operations
